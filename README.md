### Running Python Programs
To run any `.py` file:
1. Open your terminal or command prompt
2. Navigate to the folder with the file
3. Type: `python filename.py` (replace `filename.py` with the actual file name)
4. Press Enter

Example:
```
python 001_first.py
```

## 📁 Course Files

Each file follows this naming pattern: `XXX_topic_name.py`

| File | Topic | What You'll Learn |

## 💡 How to Learn Effectively

1. **Read First** - Always read through the code before running it
2. **Predict** - Try to guess what the code will do before running it
3. **Experiment** - Change things and see what happens
4. **Practice** - Complete the exercises in each file
5. **Ask Questions** - Don't hesitate to ask during class!

## 🆘 Getting Help

- **In Class**: Raise your hand and ask questions
- **Online**: Check the official Python documentation at [python.org](https://docs.python.org/3/)
- **ITSLearning**: Check course announcements and materials

## 📝 Tips for Success

- **Practice regularly** - Programming is learned by doing
- **Start small** - Don't try to write complex programs immediately
- **Read error messages** - They often tell you exactly what's wrong
- **Use meaningful names** - Choose variable names that describe what they store
- **Comment your code** - Explain what your code does in plain English

## 🎯 Learning Objectives

By the end of this course, you will be able to:
- Write basic Python programs
- Use variables and data types
- Get input from users
- Make decisions with if/else statements
- Repeat actions with loops
